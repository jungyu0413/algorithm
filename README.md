## Description

This repository was created while following the above lecture, with the goal of building strong fundamentals in algorithm problem solving and preparing for coding interviews and technical tests.

Each problem includes:
- Problem description and constraints
- Python implementation with comments
- Time & space complexity analysis (when applicable)
- Notes on algorithmic techniques used (e.g., DFS, BFS, two pointers, etc.)
